NAME
====

adjust_detector - move detector panels


SYNOPSIS
========

adjust_detector -g _input.geom_ -o _output.geom_ -p _group_ [_movement_]


DESCRIPTION
===========

**adjust_detector** moves a panel (or group of panels) in a CrystFEL detector
geometry file, and writes an updated geometry file.

To rotate a panel, use one of **--rotx**, **--roty** or **--rotz**.  The
rotation will be in degrees, clockwise when looking along the specified axis.
The center of rotation will be the centroid of the corners of the panel, or the
centroid of all the panel centers in the specified group.

To translate a panel or group, use one of **--shiftx**, **--shifty** or
**--shiftz**.  The translation will be along the positive direction of the
specified axis.  The units are pixels, unless you additionally specify
**--mm**.

You can use multiple movements together, but the results are unspecified if you
combine a rotation with any other movement (including another rotation).


OPTIONS
=======

**-g** _input.geom_
: Specify the input geometry filename.

**-o** _output.geom_
: Specify the output geometry filename.
: Note that the geometry file will be re-written, meaning that any formatting
: and comments will be lost.

**-p** _group_
: Specify the panel, or panel group, to move.

**--mm**
: Interpret panel shifts as millimetres, not pixels.

**--shiftx=***n*, **--shifty=***n*, **--shiftz=***n*
: Shift the chosen panel (or group) by _n_ along the given direction, in units
: of pixels (unless **--mm** is used).  When moving a group of panels, the
: pixel size of the *first* panel will be used.

**--rotx=***n*, **--roty=***n*, **--rotz=***n*
: Shift the chosen panel (or group) by _n_ degrees clockwise about the given
: axis.  The center of rotation will be the centroid of the corners of the
: panel, or the centroid of all the panel centers in the specified group.

**--panel-totals**
: Display the total translation and rotation changes for each panel. This does
: not affect the refinement or the output geometry file in any way, only the
: console output.
