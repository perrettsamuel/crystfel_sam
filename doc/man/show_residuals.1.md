NAME
====

show_residuals - read and display spot position residuals from Millepede data


SYNOPSIS
========

show_residuals -g _input.geom_ _millepede-files_


DESCRIPTION
===========

**show_residuals** reads the calibration data written by **indexamajig --mille**,
and displays the average Bragg peak position offsets (predicted minus observed
spot coordinates).

To interpret the Millepede data, the geometry file is required.  The geometry
file should match the one used for the **indexamajig** run that generated the
data.

The program will show the spot position offsets and the average (absolute)
excitation errors of the reflections, averaged across the detector's hierarchy
groups.  Averages will be calculated at every level of hierarchy found in the
Millepede files, limited by **indexamajig --max-mille-level**.


OPTIONS
=======

**-g** _input.geom_, **--geometry**=_input.geom_
: Specify the input geometry filename.
